# Simple Todo Frontend (React)

A minimalistic, light-themed Todo app that supports:
- Add new tasks
- Edit tasks (double-click a task)
- Delete tasks
- Mark complete/incomplete
- Filter by All / Active / Completed
- Clear completed
- Theme toggle (Light/Dark)
- Local persistence (localStorage)

## Run

- npm start — start dev server at http://localhost:3000
- npm test — run basic smoke tests
- npm run build — production build

## Usage

1. Type a task into "Add a new task..." and click Add.
2. Toggle completion with the checkbox.
3. Double-click a task to edit. Press Enter or blur to save. Esc cancels.
4. Use filters to view All, Active, or Completed tasks.
5. Clear completed removes all completed tasks.

No backend required.
